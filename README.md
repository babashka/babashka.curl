# babashka.curl

A tiny [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) wrapper via idiomatic Clojure, inspired by [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http#philosophy), [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and friends.

This library may end up in [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/). It
can be used as a library, but because we're just getting started, it may be
better to just copy the code to your scripts. If you need changes to the code,
you're welcome to contribute them back into this library.

## Status

Work in progress, early days, far from finished. Breaking changes will happen. Contributions welcome.

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.curl])

(curl/get "https://httpstat.us/200")
;;=> "200 OK"

(curl/get "https://httpstat.us/200" {:headers {"Accept" "application/json"}})
;;=> "{\"code\": 200, \"description\": \"OK\"}"
```

Passing raw arguments to `curl` can be done with `:raw-args`:

``` clojure
(curl/post "https://postman-echo.com/post"
                  {:body "From Clojure"
                   :raw-args ["-D" "-"]})
;;=> "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: application/json; ..."
```

## Test

``` clojure
$ clj -A:test
```
