# babashka.curl

A tiny [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) wrapper via idiomatic Clojure, inspired by [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http#philosophy), [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and friends.

## Status

This library may end up in
[babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/). We're just getting started
and still figuring out an API so breaking changes are likely to
happen. Therefore it may be better to just copy the code to your scripts right
now. Your tweaks are welcome as contributions.

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.curl])

(curl/get "https://httpstat.us/200")
;;=> "200 OK"

(require '[cheshire.core :as json])
(def resp (curl/get "https://httpstat.us/200" {:headers {"Accept" "application/json"}}))
(json/parse-string resp) ;;=> {"code" 200, "description" "OK"}

(def resp (curl/post "https://postman-echo.com/post" {:body "From Clojure"}))
(json/parse-string resp) ;;=> {"args" {}, "data" "", ...}
```

Basic auth:

``` clojure
(curl/get "https://postman-echo.com/basic-auth" {:basic-auth ["postman" "password"]})
```

Posting form params:

``` clojure
(curl/post "https://postman-echo.com/post" {:form-params {"name" "Michiel"}})
```

Posting a file as a POST body:

``` clojure
(curl/post "https://postman-echo.com/post" {:body (io/file "README.md")})
```

Passing raw arguments to `curl` can be done with `:raw-args`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as str])
(def resp (curl/post "https://postman-echo.com/post"
                     {:body "From Clojure"
                      :raw-args ["-D" "-"]}))
(-> (str/split resp #"\n") first) ;;=> "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r"
```

## Test

``` clojure
$ clj -A:test
```
